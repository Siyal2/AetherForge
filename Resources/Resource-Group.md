# Initial Setup & Core Configuration
Our journey begins with laying the foundational infrastructure within Azure. This section details the initial resource group configuration.


## Resource Group: AetherForge

All resources for this project will be logically organized within a dedicated Azure Resource Group named AetherForge.

- Name: AetherForge

- Subscription: Visual Studio Enterprise Subscription (as shown in the screenshot)

## Region Justification:

The choice of (US) Central US as the primary region for the AetherForge resource group is deliberate. While my current location is India, certain advanced Azure services and features, which are planned for future research and implementation within this project, are currently more comprehensively available or exclusively offered in the Central US region. This strategic decision ensures access to the full spectrum of services required to explore cutting-edge cloud architectures and maintain flexibility for future expansions.
